## Inspiration
I have a music room that i share with friends. 
I am paying the rent for the room and I need to collect a fair financial contribution from everyone to be able to maintain it. 
My friends should make their contribution based on how much they use the room. 
Let's build a booking system that makes it really easy and fair to use the room. 

## What it does
It allows people to offer their resources for rental in order to earn crypto. 
It allows people to rent some resources and pay with crypto. 
Resources can be
- rooms (e.g. for living, working, celebrating) 
- machines or tools (e.g. a power drill or a car) 
- event access (e.g. concerts, festivals) 

## How we built it
We build a mobile first web app with vue. 
Contracts are being developed in Rust on NEAR. 
Some infrastructure for media storage (technology to be decided, python maybe?).
